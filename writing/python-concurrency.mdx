# Concurrency in Python - What does it really mean?

During my internship at Google this summer, I wrote some Python code proudly thinking I improved the performance of my service.
A couple of days later I spoke with another intern, who also had experimented with some “concurrent” Python in his project, about this “optimization” of mine.
When later benchmarking my incredible speedup, I noticed I had achieved an impressive speedup of a whopping 0s (not exactly 0s but you get my point), making me slightly less proud of my concurrent Python code.
What was going on?

This led me to go down a rabbit whole of exploring the commonly used libraries providing concurrency APIs in Python, how they work, and their nuances.
While talking with some other people I also realised that there is quite a lot of confusion on how these work, so I thought I’d write a blog post exploring concurrency in Python to clear my mind and maybe helt someone else as well!

## Concurrency?

First up some basics: what even is _concurrency?_ Good thing we have Wikipedia, right?
Wikipedia informs us that “_concurrency is the ability of different parts or units of a program, algorithm or problem to be executed out-of-order or in partial order, without affecting the outcome_”.
However precise this may be , it’s not the most “explain it to me like I’m five years old”-friendly answer.
So let me rephrase into a more “five year old”-friendly definition: “Concurrency is like having multiple people working on different things at the same time”.

“But wait, isin’t that _parallelism_?” I hear someone ask.
Well, this is where a lot of confusion is originated, so read carefully now.
Concurrency means managing multiple tasks at once, while parallelism means running multiple tasks _simultaneously._
This essentially means that parallelism is a subset of concurrency.
If something is execution in a parallel manner, it’s concurrent.
However, if something is executing in a concurrent manner, it’s not necessarily parallel.

Let’s try to simplify this distinction with an example in the form of a little: imagine two circuses, Circus Conccy and Circus Paralello, with a juggling performance.
At Circus Conccy there is only one juggler juggling 5 sets of balls at once, quickly moving between the sets in order to continue the quite frankly, unbelievable, juggling performance.
Over at Circus Paralello, however, power is clearly in the numbers.
There we also find 5 sets of juggling balls in the air at the same time.
But instead of one juggler, there are 5, each juggling only one set of balls at a time.
As you probably should have understood by now, Circus Conccy is juggling concurrently, while Circus Parallello is juggling in parallel.

So what does this have to do with Python?
