Hello there! I'm Linus. ðŸ‘‹

In the past I have worked at:

[Droppe](https://droppe.com/),
[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com),

I have also worked as a Teaching Assistant on multiple courses (Data Structures and Algorithms etc.) at [Aalto Unversity Department of Computer Science](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-computer-science).

Currently I'm finishing up my studies at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en). I was on exchange at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/). I wrote my Bachelor's thesis on "[Distributed consensus by population protocols](https://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:aalto-202306063633)".
