Hello there! I'm Linus. ðŸ‘‹

I like complex problems, smart people and working on hard things. I also like all things endurance sports.
Currently I work on infrastructure performance at Palantir.

In the past I have worked at:
[Google](https://about.google/),
[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com),
[BCG](https://www.bcg.com/),
[Smartly.io](https://www.smartly.io/),
[Nokia](https://www.nokia.com/),
[Droppe](https://droppe.com/),
[Bitville](https://bitville.com/).

I have also worked as a Research Assistant for Professor [Bo Zhao](https://zbjob.github.io/) in the Data-Intensive Systems group and as a Teaching Assistant on multiple courses (Scalable Systems and Data Management, Data Structures and Algorithms etc.) at [Aalto Unversity Department of Computer Science](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-computer-science).

I've studied Computer Science at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en) and studied a semester at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/).
I wrote my Bachelor's thesis on "[Distributed consensus by population protocols](https://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:aalto-202306063633)" and my Master's thesis on _LLM-based code generation for optimized quantum circuits_, publishing a paper on the same topic: [Fine-Tuning Large Language Models on Quantum Optimization Problems for Circuit Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11109).
