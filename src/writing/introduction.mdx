Hello there! I'm Linus. I want to work with interesting people and build cool stuff. I also like all things endurance sports.

I currently work at [Smartly.io](https://www.smartly.io/).

In the past I have worked at:
[Droppe](https://droppe.com/),
[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com),
[Nokia](https://www.nokia.com/),

I have also worked as a Teaching Assistant for multiple courses (Data Structures and Algorithms etc.) at [Aalto Unversity Department of Computer Science](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-computer-science).

This May I finished my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en). I wrote my Bachelor's thesis on [distributed consensus algorithms](https://github.com/LinuzJ/distributed-consensus-bachelors-thesis).
