Hello there! I'm Linus. I want to work with interesting and curious people and build cool stuff.

I currently work at [Smartly.io](https://www.smartly.io/).

I just finished my Bachelors degree in Computer Science from [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en). I wrote my bachelors thesis on [distributed consensus algorithms](https://github.com/LinuzJ/distributed-consensus-bachelors-thesis).
